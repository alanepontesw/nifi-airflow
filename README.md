# Airflow + Nifi Tutorial
This repo contains the basics for getting up and running in [Airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org) and [Nifi](https://nifi.apache.org).

 ## Prerequisites
 1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

 In order to get the sample Airflow and Nifi instances running, navigate to the project root and execute the following command:
 ```bash
 $ docker-compose up -d
 ```

 You can now navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for Airflow and [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) for Nifi.
